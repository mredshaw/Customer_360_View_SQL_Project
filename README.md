# Customer_360_View_SQL_Project
The objective of this project is to build a Customer 360 view for the customers of an online retailer using various fact tables and dimensions stored in a PostgreSQL server. The resulting fact table will provide a comprehensive view of customer activity, including orders, conversions, and other relevant metrics.
